<b><h6>Fundraising Campaign</b></h6>  
<div><p>For our campaign, the chosen content type is an <b>Awareness Campaign Video</b>, which is proven to be an effective way to educate audiences, evoke emotions, and inspire action. By creating this type of content, we aim to highlight the needs of the community and encourage viewers to participate in our fundraising efforts . The purpose of an Awareness campaign Video is to educate and inform people about a specific cause or issue. Through this type of Youtube content, we aim to catch the attention of a wide audience and encourage them to take meaningful action. In our case, the video will not only raise awareness about the struggles of the Sitio Bebe community but will also serve as a tool to drive donations and fundraising, and active participation that can directly benefit them. By presenting clear information in an engaging way, we aim to bridge the gap between awareness and action.</p></div>

<div><p>Our target audience includes three major groups. First are the sponsors and organizations that are capable of donating funds or resources to support our project. They are important because their financial contributions can directly sustain the campaign. Second, we aim to reach individuals who have a personal interest in community projects, whether they are professionals, parents, or local volunteers. These people may not always provide large donations, but their consistent support can help sustain the cause. Lastly, we target teens and young people, who are active on social media and can help spread the campaign widely. Through sharing, reposting, and engaging with the content, they can amplify the message and attract even more supporters.</p></div>

<div><p>The content must deliver clear information, emotional storytelling, urgency, and simple calls to action. The video should explain the problem directly, feature real testimonies from beneficiaries, and emphasize why support is needed immediately.</p></div>

<div><p>The Awareness Campaign Video will be used as a documentation of our journey in reaching out to the Sitio Bebe community. It will feature real experiences, interviews, and stories from the residents, showing the challenges they face every day. Through storytelling, visuals, and the video will encourage video viewers to participate in several ways: donating money, buying tickets to the fundraising concert, or helping promote the campaign online.</p></div>

<div><p>We chose to create an Awareness Campaign Video because videos are highly engaging and shareable compared to other forms of content. People connect more deeply when they can see and hear real stories, which makes them more likely to act. By producing this kind of video, we can reach a wider audience, build stronger emotional connections, and encourage people to support our campaign.</p></div>
